### 🧩 About Me

I'm Guillem Casas — a passionate **Full Stack Developer** and **DevSecOps Engineer**. I began my career crafting backend systems, but my love for learning quickly pushed me into full stack development with **Node.js**, **Python**, **React** and **Next.js**.

Over time, I discovered a passion for **cloud infrastructure**, **automation**, and **security** — which naturally led me into the world of **DevSecOps**.
